Kaltura Player plugins use a combination of HTML, JavaScript and/or CSS to customize the Player, enabling you to use a plugin to add any feature that can be added to a web page. Plugins integrate with the Player by listening to and emitting events.

You can develop plugins to:
* Modify default behavior
* Add functionality
* Customize appearance

For a list of Kaltura-provided plugins that you can implement in your system, read the [Kaltura Player Plugins](https://github.com/kaltura/DeveloperPortalDocs/blob/master/documentation/05_Mobile-Video-Player-SDKs/Player-Plugins-in-the-SDK-Supported-plugins.md#sthash.3a8Dft10.dpbs) article.

## How to Enable/Create a Plugin  
This section describes how to enable existing Kaltura plugins and how to create your own plugins.

#### Using an Existing Plugin

1. If you want to change or add a plugin, the key should begin with the plugin name, dot and the plugin attribute. Every plugin includes the plugin attributes required for enabling or disabling the plugin.
2. In order to add a plugin, use the addConfigKey function for [iOS](https://github.com/kaltura/player-sdk-native-ios/blob/master/KALTURAPlayerSDK/KPPlayerConfig.h#L57) or [Android](https://github.com/kaltura/player-sdk-native-android/blob/master/playerSDK/src/main/java/com/kaltura/playersdk/KPPlayerConfig.java#L86). Note that the first parameter takes the key name and the second takes the value.

In the example below, the loadingSpinner plugin has been disabled:

```
// objective_c
[config addConfigKey:@"loadingSpinner.plugin" withValue:@"false"];
```
```
// Java
config.addConfig("loadingSpinner.plugin", "false");
```

#### Creating Custom Plugins
To create custome plugins, follow the steps in the article [Extending the Player with Plugins](/api-docs/media-player/Player-Plugins#sthash.gtmiiI7F.dpbs).

2. Follow the instructions in * "Receiving  a Notification when the Player API is Ready" to detect if configured plugins are loaded.

### How to Get Notified about Player Plugin-Related Callbacks
