This section provides troubleshooting solutions for common Player issues.

## iOS: App Transport Security (ATS)  

iOS 9 and above include a security feature that, by default, blocks all non-TLS connections. However, since many servers still do not support TLS, there are exclusion keys that can be set in the app's `Info.plist` file.

The most permissive setting is to disable ATS entirely. This is done by setting `NSAppTransportSecurity:NSAllowsArbitraryLoads` to `YES`:

```xml
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
	...
	<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
	<dict>
		<key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
		<true/>
	</dict>
	...
</dict>
</plist>
```

> Note: If there's a known limited set of domains that must to be accessed without TLS, it is advised to whitelist them explicitly. 
For more information about fine-grained control of ATS see:

## iOS: Bitcode  

Starting with [Xcode 7](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/releasenotes/DeveloperTools/RN-Xcode/Chapters/xc7_release_notes.html), bitcode is enabled by default. However, building an application with bitcode requires that all of the static libraries that are being used are also built with bitcode.

The Widevine Classic library (`libWViPhoneAPI.a`) included with the Kaltura SDK is not built with bitcode; as a result, your application will need to disable bitcode in its own linker settings.

## Android: Device Info

Use Kaltura Device Info app to generate a report of device capabilities with regards to media playback and DRM.
Get the app here: [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kaltura.kalturadeviceinfo) | [source](https://github.com/kaltura/kaltura-device-info-android).

Install and execute the application. After the report (in JSON format) is shown, tap the share button to share the report with Kaltura (preferably via email).

## Android: ExoPlayer Demo

Another way to diagnose DRM and playback issues on Android is by using the ExoPlayer Demo app. This app is provided in source by Google, and it allows playing some Google-provided streams.
We have built a version of the app, [available as an APK](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/125871244/apps/testapps/drm/exoplayer/exoplayer-demo-v1.5.7.apk).

Install and execute the application, then run all tests in the "Widevine DASH Policy Tests" section. Keep note of the passing and failing tests.
> Note: **Don't** expect all tests to pass, as some require specialized hardware and security features.
