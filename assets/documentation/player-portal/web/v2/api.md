# Kaltura Player - Fast, Flexible, Video Player Toolkit

This documentation covers version **_2.74.1__1e322ce7_** of the html5 library. 

The kWidget API is available after you include the Kaltura player library. kWidget provides embedding and basic utility functions. The Kaltura player library can be embedded into both 

. 

After you include the Kaltura player library, the following kWidget API is available: 

* * *

#### kWidget.embed ( [targetId], settings)

Used to embed the Kaltura player against an element target in the DOM

##### PARAMETERS:

* **targetId** String _( Optional )_ The DOM player target id attribute string. ( if not included, you must include targetId in "settings" object )
* **settings** [kWidget.settingsObject][1] Object of settings to be used in embedding.

##### RETURNS:

* boolean|null Returns boolean false if id not found

##### EXAMPLES:

* * *

#### kWidget.thumbEmbed ( [targetId], settings)

Used to embed a thumbnail player. When the user clicks on the thumbnail kWidget.embed will be called with the provided settings.

##### PARAMETERS:

* **targetId** String _( Optional )_ The DOM player target id attribute string. ( if not included, you must include targetId in "settings" object
* **settings** [kWidget.settingsObject][1] Object of settings to be used in embedding.

##### EXAMPLES:

* * *

#### kWidget.getKalturaThumbUrl (settings)

##### PARAMETERS:

* **readyCallback** String Function to call after a player or widget is ready on the page.

##### EXAMPLES:

* * *

#### kWidget.destroy (target)

Removes the player from the DOM.

##### PARAMETERS:

* **target** String The target element or element ID to destroy.

##### EXAMPLES:

###  User Agent and Feature Detection 

* * *

#### kWidget.isMobileDevice ()

If user agent identifies as mobile device ( android, iOS or windows phone )

* * *

#### kWidget.supportsHTML5 ()

If the device or browser supports HTML5

* * *

#### kWidget.supportsFlash ()

If the device or browser supports Flash ( version 10 and above )

* * *

###  Settings Embed Object: 

* * *

#### kWidget.settingsObject

* **targetId** String The DOM player target id attribute string if not defined as top level param.
* **wid** String Widget id, usually the partner id prefixed by underscore.
* **uiconf_id** Number _( Optional )_ The player uiconf_id
* **entry_id** String The content entry id. Can be left empty for a JavaScript based entry id.

* **readyCallback** Function _( Optional )_ Local callback method to be called once player is ready for bindings. Player id is passes as an argument. See [live example][2]

### Server API requests ( kWidget.api )

kWidget Server API enables direct [Kaltura Server API][3] calls from JavaScript. This should not be confused with the [JavaScript client library][4], which offers object mappings and works with the code generated in the [test me console][5].   
The Kaltura Server API offers minimal object validation, in exchange for being much smaller, and included with every kaltura player library include.

Creating a kWidget API object, issue a playlist request, log the result: 
    
    
    new kWidget.api( { 'wid' : '_243342', })
    .doRequest({'service':'playlist', 'action': 'execute', 'id': '1_e387kavu'}, 
    	function( data ){
    		console.log( data );
    	}
    );
    

For more examples see the [kWidget.api test page.][6]

* * *

#### kWidget.api (apiObject, callback)

##### PARAMETERS:

* **apiObject** [kWidget.apiOptions][7] Object of API settings to be used in API requests.
* **callback** function Callback of API response, with data as the first argument.

##### RETURNS:

* kWidget.api Returns an instance of the kWidget API object.

##### EXAMPLES:

* * *

#### kWidget.apiOptions

* **wid** String The partner id to be used in the API request.
* **ks** String The Kaltura secret to be used in the request, if not supplied an anonymous KS will be generated and used.
* **serviceUrl** String Can be overwritten to target a different Kaltura server.

* **statsServiceUrl** String Default supplied via Kaltura library include, can be overwritten to alternate URL for core analytics events.
* **disableCache** String Sends no-cache param to API, for a fresh result. Should be used sparingly.

## Player Configuration key value pairs ( UiVars )

[Services »][8] [MediaEntry »][9] [Layout »][10] [Playback »][11] [PlayerProperties »][12] [MediaProxy »][13]  

UiVars enable configuration of all player features. There are two classes of UiVars: 

* top level configuration options
* plugins configuration options
These values can be set a few ways:

Within the [player studio][14] UiVar configuration appears plugins -> uivars:  
![][15]

You can control the raw JSON code for UiVars by modifying the "uiVars" section of the JSON config using the [player version utility][16]. 
    
    
    {
       "plugins":{
    	/* plugins go here */
       },
       "uiVars": [{
    	"key": "autoPlay",
    	"value": false,
    	"overrideFlashvar": false
       }]
    }
    

Player configuration can be set at embed time as "flashvars": 
    
    
    kWidget.embed({
    	...
    	flashvars:{
    		"autoPlay": false
    	}
    })
    

All player properties can also be retrieved at runtime or used in plugins macro evaluations. 
    
    
    kWidget.addReadyCallback( function(playerId){
    	alert( document.getElementById( playerId ).evaluate("{autoPlay}") );
    })
    

Finally many properties can be updated at runtime using [setKDPAttribute][17].

Using a standard OOP dot notation, each KDP component and plugin attribute can be overridden via Flashvars: objectId.parameter=value.  
For example, to set the playlist to load automatically, pass the following Flashvar: playlistAPI.autoPlay=true

Code sample:  

    
    
    kWidget.embed({
      "targetId": "kaltura_player_1402219661",
      "wid": "_1645161",

    		'closedCaptions': {
    				'layout': 'ontop',
    				'useCookie': true,
    				'defaultLanguageKey': 'en',
    				'fontsize': 12,
    				'bg' : '0x335544',

## Player API

The JavaScript API is a two-way communication channel that lets the player communicate what it is doing and lets you instruct the player to perform operations.   
For more information: [JavaScript API for Kaltura Media Players][42]

Available JavaScript API:

[Ready Notifications][43] [sendNotification][44] [Bind][45] [unBind][46] [Evaluate][47] [Update properties][17]

### Receiving notification that the player API is ready

See [kWidget.addReadyCallback][48] or the "[readyCallback][1]" function within a dynamic embed.

### Calling a player method from JavaScript

Use the **sendNotification** method to create custom notifications that instruct the player to perform an action, such as play, seek, or pause.
* * *

#### sendNotification (notificationName, [notificationData])

Call a KDP notification (perform actions using this API, for example: play, pause, changeMedia, etc.)

##### PARAMETERS:

* **notificationName** String The name of notification to call.
* **notificationData** Object _( Optional )_ The custom data to pass with the notification.

Code sample:  

    
    
    kWidget.addReadyCallback( function( playerId ){
    	var kdp = document.getElementById( playerId );
    	kdp.kBind( 'mediaReady', function(){
    		// Seek to 30 seconds from the start of the video
    		kdp.sendNotification("doSeek", 30);
    	})
    });
    

#### Available Notifications:

* doPause  
Pauses media playback.  
[Usage Example][49]
* doPlay  
Plays media. If in stopped state will initiate playback sequence.  
[Usage Example][49]
* doStop

[Usage Example][49]
* doSeek  
Issues a seek.  
Notification Data: FloatSeconds of target seek position.  
Sample:
    
        kdp.sendNotification("doSeek", 30);

[Usage Example][50]
* changeMedia  
Change the current media entry within the player.  
Notification Data: ObjectData object can specify an entryId or referenceId  
Sample:
    
        kdp.sendNotification("changeMedia", { "entryId" : "0_wm82kqmm" });
    
        kdp.sendNotification("changeMedia", { "mediaProxy" : mediaProxyObject });

  
[Usage Example][51]
* changeVolume  
Change the audio volume  
Notification Data: FloatVolume value from 0 to 1  
Sample:
    
        kdp.sendNotification("changeVolume", 0.5);

  
[Usage Example][52]
* cleanMedia  
Cleans the media from the player.
* doSwitch  
Command the player to manually switch between streams within the resource.  
Notification Data: ObjectSwitch to a target flavor index  
Sample:

#### Registering to a player event ( kBind )

Use the **kBind** method to add listen for a specific notification that something happened in the player, such as the video is playing or is paused.
* * *

#### kBind (eventName, callback)

Register a JavaScript handler function for a KDP notification

##### PARAMETERS:

* **eventName** String The name of the notification to listen to. Can be namespaced for easy group event removal.
* **callback** String A function to be called when the named event is triggered.

##### EXAMPLES:

Code sample:  

    
    
    kWidget.addReadyCallback(function( playerId ){
    	var kdp = document.getElementById( playerId );
    	// binds an event and namespces it to "myPluginName"
    	kdp.kBind("playerUpdatePlayhead.myPluginName", function( data, id ){
    		// data = the player's progress time in seconds
    		// id = the ID of the player that fired the notification
    	});
    });
    

### Un-registering a player event

Use the **kUnbind** method to remove a listener that is no longer needed.

Removing event listeners that are no longer needed can improve performance 

Code sample:  

    
    
    kWidget.addReadyCallback(function( playerId ){
    	var kdp = document.getElementById( playerId );
    	// removes all events namespaced with "myPluginName"
    	kdp.kUnbind(".myPluginName");
    	// removes events by event name: 
    	kdp.kUnbind("playerUpdatePlayhead");
    });

###  Stand Alone Player Modes 

Kaltura player supports several modes for associating content and configuration with the player. To evaluate of what is best for your integration requirements we strongly recommend consulting with Kaltura Solutions team.

* **MediaProxy Override** \-- Overrides media and player configuration at embed time. 
    * Good for "light" integrations tests a few lines of JavaScript
    * Can be used with changeMedia, to retain CDN cache for player & config
    * Not good for portability, native apps, or player iframe services.
    * Not compatible with entity baased plugins or clip lists ( playlist, related videos, bumper ) 
* **Embed Services Lib** \-- The "embed service" library includes tools for translating your own entitiy and player JSON data store against Kaltura player provided identifiers. 
    * Recommended approach for connecting the player to multiple entity services outside of Kaltura API
    * Retains portability, native apps, and player iframe services.
    * Compatible with entity baaed plugins or clip lists ( playlist, related videos, etc. ) 
* ** Kaltura Platform API ** \-- baseline platform data provider 
    * Uses Kaltura provided entries with flexible custom MetaData store, internal and external asset urls references etc.
